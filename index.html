        "This is biblical"
        The thought ran through my head as I looked at the sky. I'm not sure what I had thought being in a massive fire would look like, but it wasn't this. Every inch of the sky was covered in smoke and ash. The normal white clouds and blue sky were completely obscured by the firestorm. Blooms of red light appeared here and there (probably from the sun trying to get through) giving the impression that the sky ITSELF was on fire. It boiled and rolled. It was death from above. 
      </p>

      <div id="post1" style="display:none;">
        <p>  It boiled and rolled. It was death from above. 
        
        My mind couldn't help but wander and try to find an apt comparison. The scene in Indepence Day where the aliens first arrive; the one where their ships created a fire cloud when entering our atmosphere came to mind. It looked exactly like that. Yeah I know...the world is 'ending', people are shouting and screaming. Evacuations have started, Fire trucks are blaring, and I'm over here comparing the sky to a Sci-Fi movie. 
        I put the report into the background of my mind while I tried to remember all the disaster preparedness drills I had growing up. One thing I knew from personal experience, was that one of the first things to go is water. Sink water becomes toxic and undrinkable, but that hasn't happened to us yet. 
          I went to work grabbing every single pot, cup, mug, glass and bowl we had and filled them with clean water. I stored them anywhere I could. They were on the tables, the counters and the stoves. </p>
          Next, I ran into the hallway cabinet to grab every candle I owned. 
          <p>Thankfully, this was during an emo rock phase of mine so I had 20 or so large candles and dozens of tea lights. Who ever said moody blues couldn't save a life? I knew that the next thing to go would be power, so I placed two candles in every room and the extras in the main room.
          I started putting together a bag of things to grab in a hurry and was sorting out the food situation when there was a bang on the door. 
          I crossed the room and opened it to a firefighter standing right outside. "This area has now been listed for mandatory evacuation. You guys need to leave. The freeway is closed going Westbound so you'll have to go East on the 8 until you hit the Descanso evacuation point (about 10-20 miles up the mountain).  I thanked the firefighter and assured him that we would be leaving as quickly as we could. I ran to the car and took stuff out to make space for essentials. It was then that I noticed my fuel tank was low.  I cursed under my breath and hopped in the car to rush to a gas station. There was one only two blocks away but it took well over 30 minutes to get there. Every four way intersection was jammed from people who were panicking and didn't want to stop at the red light. The result was a giant mess of car horns and frantic talking. As I stood on the corner, I saw one car gun it and hit another. 
      
          <p>By the time I got to the gas station, it was empty. That should have been my first sign. There was a notice on every pump as well as the store declaring the gas station was shut down due to the fires. It made perfect sense. If a fire is approaching, the last thing you want is a source of fuel to feed it. They probably shut all their underground tanks and turned off the pumps hours before. It was so logical it made me laugh.  Why didn't movies ever show stuff like this? 
          With my car on empty, I drove back to the apartments and decided I needed to come up with a Plan B. I didn't have enough gas to get us to the evacuation point. 
          An hour later I had everything packed and ready. My little brother was near and I was doing my best to calm him down while I had to triage which pets would be able to fit in my small Geo Storm. I hated the idea that we couldn't take them all but the fire was getting closer and we were running out of time. I walked outside every few minutes to look at the sky and horizon, checking for the tell tale flickers of the fire itself when I suddenly noticed it was snowing. </p>
          
          I looked down and saw what seemed to be white and grey snowflakes covering my shoulders, hands and black shirt. It was ash. Heavy ash that would rain down and not stop for three days straight. 
          My car had a light dusting on it and the ash was pooling up on the ground at the edges of the sidewalk and bushes. "Another thing they don't show in movies" I thought as I turned back to go inside. I was alarmed. The air quality hadn't been great from the moment the fires started, but this was different. You couldn't breathe in without inhaling large pieces of ash that tasted immediately like cigarettes, choking you. 
          "Fuck" 
          I ran around the unit closing every window I could. We could preserve the air inside, even if the outside was bad. Once locked, I gathered every small towel I could find and started lining the windows and door cracks. 
          Surprisingly, my mind wasn't racing. Go figure. 
          On a regular day, my anxiety causes me fight or flight responses and during an actual emergency, I feel as calm as if I had just done yoga. 
          
          "What do we do Dayo?" he asked, and I told him not to worry, that we were safe and that we had a plan. The ash cloud outside had completely obscured the sun so there was no light coming through the windows, despite it being only 1pm in the middle of the Summer. I sat down to figure out what to do next when I heard a sudden "bang", followed by the power being shut off in the most dramatic way, leaving us in darkness.
